# StuxxTools

## Technical Documentation

Stuxxkit will consist of 2 individual projects: StuxxTools - A multi-platform 
app, and StuxxBot - a Discord bot.
StuxxTools will be a multi-platform all in one application that will contain a 
variety of media tools, to be more specific audio, video, and image converters, as well as a doc(x) to pdf and back converter.

StuxxBot will be a discord bot for playing youtube videos in your voice 
chanel, as well as Spotify tracks. It will come with a variety of controls, such as 
`play`, `pause`, `skip`, `add` to `queue`, `remove` from `queue`, `add` whole `playlist`, `volume 
up/down` etc.

Languages for these projects:
- StuxxTools: `C#` and `XAML` with `.NET MAUI` framework
- StuxxBot: `Python`

StuxxTools will be using the .NET MAUI framework for easy compatibility on 
all 4 major platforms: Windows, Android, Mac and iOS. That means it will work on 
every single platform with their corresponding UI’s already implemented in them.

## User Guide

### 1. StuxxTools

StuxxTools is a very user-friendly app which lets you quickly choose the 
operation that you need without needing an account or any other useless stuff!
When you start up the app, you will be greeted directly with all the 
functionalities of this app in a grid like manner. Just click the icon corresponding 
to the operation you need and you’re good to go!
The PDF converter is really easy to use. Just upload a file you want 
to convert and let our app do the magic. In a few seconds your file will be 
converted and you can grab it from the app folder.
The same goes with our audio, video, image format converter. Just select which format 
you want to convert from and to, drag your file into the app and it will be 
ready in seconds.
Don’t forget to check out the Other fun stuff category!

### 2. StuxxBot

This Discord bot was created in response to YouTube’s and Discord’s policy 
towards YouTube videos. We don’t care if they blocked the top bots, we will 
revive this function and never going to remove it.
First off you need to invite the bot to your server, by accessing a link that 
will be provided later on. Then you’re good to go!
You can simply play a video with the `/play` command, along with the URL 
of the video you want to play (audio only, obviously). You will have all the controls 
displayed as reactions to the “Now playing” message. You can skip, pause, play, 
volume up/down from there! Or alternatively, you can do all these from the 
corresponding commands, like `/pause`, `/skip`, `/np` (as now playing), and 
mamny more. For the list with all the commands, do `/help`
