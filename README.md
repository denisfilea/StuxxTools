# StuxxTools

## Technical Documentation

Stuxxkit will consist of 2 individual projects: StuxxTools - A multi-platform 
app, and StuxxBot - a Discord bot.
StuxxTools will be a multi-platform all in one application that will contain a 
variety of media tools, to be more specific audio, video, and image converters, as well as a doc(x) to pdf and back converter.

Languages for these projects:
StuxxTools: `C#` and `XAML` with `.NET MAUI` framework

StuxxTools will be using the .NET MAUI framework for easy compatibility on 
all 4 major platforms: Windows, Android, Mac and iOS. That means it will work on 
every single platform with their corresponding UI’s already implemented in them.
